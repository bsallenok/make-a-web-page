          <p>
            A user opens a browser on their computer such as Firefox and requests information
            from a URL such as <a href="http://WWW.Udacity.com">Udacity.com.</a>  The set of rules used to traverse the world wide web is called <span class="bold">HTTP</span> or <span class="italic">Hyper Transfer Protocol</span> and the information sought might be a webpage containing text, videos, images etc. The webpage displayed is written in a language the computer understands called <span class="bold">HTML</span> or <span class="italic">Hypertext Markup Language</span>
            <span class="bold">HTTP</span> finds the <span class="bold">HTML</span> document on the correct server (another type of computer that 
            stores information) and sends it back where the browser 
            interprets and displays 
            the information on the user's screen.

            the computer understands.  The sentence: "I'm <span class="bold">learning</span> to code!"--for example--requires a special "code" to tell the computer to make the letters in the word "learning" appear in <span class="bold">bold</span> type.

          Why Programmers are so Smart

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            Programmers have to be smart because computers are stupid!  Programmers must write code in the correct syntax because computers translate the code literally; this can be frustrating but with extreme focus--powerful. Programmers are smarter than computers but they cannot remember all the rules!  If you forget a rule--just look it up!

            In programming language there are <span class="bold">tag, element</span>  and <span class="bold">attribute</span>definitions and rules.  In HTML, the <span class="bold">text</span> is <span class="italic">what you see</span> and the <span class="bold">markup</span> is <span class="italic">what it looks like.</span> A tag was used in the previous sentence to make the letters in the word "text" and "markup" appear <span class="bold">bold</span>; it requires an opening tag and a closing tag to create the appearance.  The word "text" is called the <span class="bold">content</span>  and the entire length of this information end to end is called an <span class="bold">element.</span> 
          </p>
          <p>
            As mentioned there are <span class="bold">attributes</span> within elements.  You can look them up on the internet but let me share another example here because <span class="bold">coding is fun!</span> Some tags require an "attribute" like the "img" tag requires an opening tag, an attribute: "src", a link to the image, an "alt" attribute containing text to desribe the image; this is for two reasons 1) in case the link is broken and 2) for the blind.  What no closing tag?  "img" is a <span class="bold">void</span>  tag; and therefore, does not require a closing tag.

            HTML elements are "inline" or "block."  The difference between <span class="bold">inline</span> and <span class="bold">block</span> is that block elements like "p" for paragraph form an <span>invisible box</span> around the content inside of them.

            HTML and <span class="bold">CSS</span> Cascading Style Sheets are two of the many languages used to create web pages.  HTML develops the classification or structure and CSS provides the style or look and feel of a web page.  When programmers talk about <span class="bold">DOM</span> Document Object Model, they are talking about the <span class="italic">tree-like</span> structure of a web page. Beginner web page developers should start with big boxes, move to small boxes and literally sketch out their web design with a pen or pencil. Programmers define boxes or containers around their content with <span class="bold">div</span> tags. The <span class="bold">div</span> tag is one of the most important tags used to organize HTML into big and small boxes needed to organize and structure HTML. They use "span" and other tags to help with the styling of their content.

          <p>
            Text editors like <span class="bold">Scratchpad, Codepen</span>  and <span class="bold">Sublime</span> make writing code easier.  For example, Scratchpad is good for beginners because what's been coded is immediately displayed in a split screen view. Sublime anticipates the tag you need with a pop-up selection box triggered by one or two key-strokes.

          Adding Style with CSS

        <div class="concept-description">   
          <p>
            Programmers use CSS to add style to their HTML structure by
            using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS Reference.</a> Programmers learn possible values and properties of attributes they need to convert their mockup to code. <span class="bold">Cascading</span> means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' children. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.

          The Box Model and Avoiding Repetition with CSS
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">  
          <p>
            Programmers define boxes around their content with "div" tags but its important to remember to use standards. Using standards while positioning boxes will apply the proper semantics, allow all browsers to read your code and any programmer to edit your code.  In addition, avoiding repetition in your code styling will facilitate changes and avoid errors. Standard and consistent use of the <span class="bold">class</span> attribute and CSS Reference will make good practice needed to refine your ability.

          <p>
            Perfect practice calls for <span class="italic">code, test, and refine</span> behavior: look for natural boxes in your design; look for repeated styles and semantic elements; write your HTML; apply styles from Biggest to smallest (Thanks Jacques!); and finally continue to fix your code. These five behaviors will make for perfect practice on your road to fluency!
